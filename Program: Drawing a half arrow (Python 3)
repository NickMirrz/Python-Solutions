Program: Drawing a half arrow (Python 3)
This zyLab activity is the traditional programming assignment, typically requiring a few hours over a week. The previous section provides warm up exercises intended to help a student prepare for this programming assignment.



This program outputs a downwards facing arrow composed of a rectangle and a right triangle. The arrow dimensions are defined by user specified arrow base height, arrow base width, and arrow head width.

(1) Modify the given program to use a loop to output an arrow base of height arrow_base_height. (1 pt)



(2) Modify the given program to use a loop to output an arrow base of width arrow_base_width. (1 pt)



(3) Modify the given program to use a loop to output an arrow head of width arrow_head_width. (2 pts)



(4) Modify the given program to only accept an arrow head width that is larger than the arrow base width. Use a loop to continue prompting the user for an arrow head width until the value is larger than the arrow base width. (1 pt)

while arrow_head_width <= arrow_base_width:
    print ('Enter arrow head width: ')
    arrow_head_width = int(input())


Example output for arrow_base_height = 5, arrow_base_width = 2, and arrow_head_width = 4:

Enter arrow base height: 5
Enter arrow base width: 2
Enter arrow head width: 4
